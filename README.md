* Short description of what you attempted to build
  * We bulit a Tensorflow deep learning model for identifying images from different angles using this dataset: http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php
  * We first did a tutorial on Tensorflow to identify items of clothing and then attempted our own
* Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
  * We each did the tutorial individually and then worked next to each other to figure out the real dataset.
* What you learned
  * We learned how to implement a basic deep learning model for classifying image data.
* How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
  * We have considered trying a project with machine learning and doing this hack helped us figure out what can be done and how difficult it might be.
* What didnâ€™t work
  * We tried to do a facial recognition model and had a lot of trouble figuring out how to deal with the dataset.
